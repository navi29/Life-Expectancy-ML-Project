# Life-Expectancy-ML-Project
This is Python Machine Learning Project in which we can predict average life expectancy of a person under some conditions

Life expectancy is a statistical measure of the average time a human being is expected to live.  Life expectancy varies by geographical area and by era. In the Bronze age, for example, life expectancy was 26 years, while in 2010, it was 67 years. Life expectancy of a country depends on various factors: Regional variations, Economic Circumstances, Sex Differences, Mental Illnesses, Physical Illnesses, Education, Year, GDP, alcohol intake of people in the country, expenditure on healthcare system, some specific disease related deaths that happened in the country and other demographic factors 
Whereas, the life expectancy for a particular person or a group of people depends on several variables such as their lifestyle, access to Healthcare, Economical status and the relevant Mortality and Morbidity data. However, as life expectancy is calculated based on averages, a person may live for many years more or less than expected. A country’s life expectancy may decrease in a particular year due to some unknown diseases or new virus discovered in that year.

The Objective of this Project is to build a model which can predict the life expectancy of a country according to past statistical data of the country.
This Project includes:
•	Analysis of the Expectancy Dataset.
•	Applying Regression models to the data.
